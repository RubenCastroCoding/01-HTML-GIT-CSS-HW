<h2 align="center">Description</h2>
This is my first weeks homework repository. This weeks assignment was to refactor some code provided by the school. There was some links that were not working so i did some changes to the html. Also there was alot of classes that were being used more than once. I wrote some commnents explaining what css styles did. Made sure my website worked with no errors.
